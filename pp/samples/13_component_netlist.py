""" DEPRECATED: use pp.component_from_yaml instead!

Sometimes, when a component is mostly composed of sub-components adjacent to each other, it can be easier to define the component by:

- subcomponents
- connections
- exposed ports in the new components

This can be done using a netlist based approach where these 3 parts are defined:

- components: a dictionnary of {component reference name: (component, transform)}
- connections: a list of (component ref name 1, port name A, component ref name 2, port name B)
- ports_map: a dictionnary of which ports are being exposed together with their new name {port_name: (component ref name, port name)}

The code below illustrates how a simple MZI can be formed using this method.
